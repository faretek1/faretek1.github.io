This is the docs for [my backend server running on vercel](https://github.com/faretek1/faretek-api/). 

## about

[faretek-api](https://api.faretek.dev) is a sever running flask which is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

??? Question "Verifying the source code"
    
    If you are not confident that the vercel instance is running the exact same code as the GitHub repository,
    I've made the source open from Vercel so that you can verify it 
    (if you know of a better way of doing this, do tell).

    ### Getting the deployment details  

    This gives the url of this commit, and some other information like the build logs.

    1. Navigate to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/faretek1/faretek-api).
    2. Click the tick next to the latest commit (If you want to verify an older instance, you can do that too).
    3. Goto the link `Details` next to the Vercel Deployment check.
    
    ### Viewing source

    If you want to view the source code, you can click the `Source` tab at the top of the page. 

    Or if the previous page resulted in an error:

    4. Append `/source` to the end of the `Details` url and press enter.
    5. You should be able to see the source code. It should be identical to the GitHub repository at the latest commit.
