yeah i copied that post metadata from yesterday. This isn't a valuable blog post but i need that green ahh github activity grid

Today i set up [copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) on my samsung a3 running android 8. Termux and copyparty are just unreasonably good.

I still have to handle adding some accounts for people who i want to add, and working out how it does hashes, etc etc.
But I think this helps serve a signle, pretty cool point.

Copyparty is just insanely feature rich.

Take a look at their [readme](https://github.com/9001/copyparty#-copyparty).

Looks reasonable, right? Well take a look at the right. That thicc ahh super massive scroll bar. Copyparty has a *lot* of features.

If you have [the Refined GitHub browser extension](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) installed, you will also see that it's 7 years old.

###### why do i have to convert that img tag format to a `![](...)` format all the time.. :\

Also, the guy said he spent much of his time on a bus coding copyparty on the way to work or smth.
I guess that shows the power of termux (& vim)

Here's the official copyparty youtube video: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=15_-hgsX2V0>

###### uh well it looks like [i screwed up the metadata](https://github.com/faretek1/faretek1.github.io/actions/runs/20680727045/job/59374548499). oops
