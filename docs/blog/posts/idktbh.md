# idk

it's been a while since i posted smth here.

i'm writing this from teh github web interface

i've been doing a couple of things recently - a bit of typing training, messing with lazyvim, and wasting time on geometry dash and mindustry

i also am now using glazewm+windhawk for my windows setup. people are mistaking it for linux lol

i am reluctant to work on programming projects because of my projects being too ambitious. But i'll get there some day
